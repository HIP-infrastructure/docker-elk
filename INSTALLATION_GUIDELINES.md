# Installation guidelines

## First ELK Stack Deployment

If you are starting from scratch, please make sure the following dependencies are installed:

* Docker / Docker compose: Software containerization engine
* `certbot`: Tool to generate Let's Encrypt Trusted SSL certificates
* `make`: Tool to ease the installation and deployment

This should be achieved on Ubuntu will the following commands:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
# Setup the docker debian repository
$ sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg
$ sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
$ sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
$ echo "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] \
https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
"$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
$ sudo apt-get update
# Install Docker tools
$ sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
# Install make and certbot
$ sudo apt-get install make certbot
```

Then, please follow these steps:


1. Clone the repo:

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/HIP-infrastructure/docker-elk.git
    ```

2. Fetch and checkout the `tls-8-6` branch:

    ```bash
    $ git fetch
    $ git checkout â€“track origin/tls-8-6
    ```

3. Copy `.env.template` as `.env` and edit or use an existing one

4. Make the full deployment from scratch:

    ```bash
    $ make deploy-with-certbot
    ```

    First, this will make sure the stack is down and the elasticsearch volume is removed. Then, this will start by calling `certbot`, where you will be prompted to enter different source of information to generate Let's encrypt SSL certificate files used for kibana. Then, this will generate the rest of the SSL certificates with the elasticsearch `certutil` tool, and replace the ones of kibana by the ones generated by `certbot`. Finally, when all certificates are ready, the stack is deployed in detached mode (e.g. `docker compose up -d`).

    You can see the logs of the different containers of the stacks by running:

        ```bash
        $ docker logs docker-elk-setup-1
        $ docker logs docker-elk-elasticsearch-1
        $ docker logs docker-elk-kibana-1
        ```

    To see the whole status of the ELK stack:

        ```bash
        $ docker-compose ps
        ```

## ELK Stack Redeployment

As soon as the ELK stack has been deployed a first, the typical command to redeploy it is:

    ```bash
    $ make redeploy
    ```

    This command will first make sure that all containers of the stacks are down, but will keep the existing elasticsearch volume to make the data persistent. Then, it will skip `certbot` but will regenerate the rest of the SSL certificates with the elasticsearch `certutil` tool and the symlinks for kibana. Finally, when all certificates are ready, the stack is deployed in detached mode (e.g. `docker compose up -d`).

Alternatively, if you wish to reset your elasticsearch instance, you could use:

    ```bash
    $ make deploy
    ```

    This command will proceed to the same workflow provided by `make redeploy` command, except that it will remove the elastic volume. This acts as a reset, which loose all existing indices and indexed datasets. In addition, setup with creation of users / roles is run again. 

## Wish to launch `certbot`?

This can be achieved by the following command:

    ```bash
    $ make certbot
    ```

## Want to see the list of available `make` commands?

    ```bash
    $ make
    ```
    ```output
    stack-down-except-volume       Make the stack down (except volume)
    stack-down-all                 Make the stack down and removing volume
    generate_tls_instances         Fill hostname and IP with values of environment variables
    cert                           Generare initial certificates with "docker-compose up tls"
    certbot                        Generare CA trusted certificates for ELK_HOSTNAME"
    stack-up                       Deploy ELK stack
    clean-cert-all                 Remove whole directory with certificates
    clean-kibana-cert              Clean kibana SSL certificate and key files
    certbot-kibana-symlinks        Make symlinks to certificates generated by certbot for kibana.
    deploy-with-certbot            Full deployment from scratch. It calls certbot to generate a CA trusted SSL certificate.
    deploy                         Deployment of ELK stack with deletion of volume. This acts as resetting elasticsearch.
    redeploy                       Typical redeployment of ELK stack where we want to keep the volume to make elasticsearch data persistent.
